## Introduction to Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward.

Agent --> Action --> Environment --> Reward/State --> Agent


### Key Characteristics:
- **Agent:** Learner or decision-maker.
- **Environment:** The external system with which the agent interacts.
- **State:** Current situation returned by the environment.
- **Action:** Decision made by the agent.
- **Reward:** Feedback from the environment.

## Core Concepts of Reinforcement Learning

### 1. **Markov Decision Process (MDP):**
   - Defines the environment for RL.
   - Consists of States (S), Actions (A), Rewards (R), and State Transition Probabilities (P).

### 2. **Policy:**
   - A mapping from state to action.
   - Deterministic or stochastic.

### 3. **Value Function:**
   - Predicts the expected reward of states or actions.

### 4. **Q-Learning:**
   - Off-policy learning algorithm.
   - Updates Q-values (action-value function) iteratively.

## Deep Reinforcement Learning

Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) combines neural networks with RL to solve complex problems.

### Why Deep Learning?
- Handles high-dimensional state spaces.
- Learns features automatically.

## Deep Q-Networks (DQN)

DQN uses deep neural networks to approximate the Q-value function.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Experience Replay:** Stores past experiences to break correlations between consecutive samples.
- **Target Network:** Stabilizes training by periodically updating the target network.

### DQN Algorithm:
1. Initialize replay memory and Q-network.
2. For each episode:
   - Observe state, select action using Îµ-greedy policy.
   - Perform action, observe reward, next state.
   - Store experience in replay memory.
   - Sample random batch from replay memory.
   - Update Q-network using backpropagation.

**Keras Example:**

```python
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras.optimizers import Adam

# Define the Q-network
def build_model(state_size, action_size):
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(Dense(24, input_dim=state_size, activation='relu'))
    model.add(Dense(24, activation='relu'))
    model.add(Dense(action_size, activation='linear'))
    model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.001))
    return model
```

## Policy Gradient Methods

Policy Gradient methods directly optimize the policy.

### Key Techniques:
- **REINFORCE Algorithm:** Uses Monte Carlo sampling to update policy parameters.
- **Actor-Critic Methods:** Combines value function (critic) and policy (actor).


## Practical Implementation with Keras

### Case Study: AI in Car Racing Game

#### Problem Statement:
Implement an AI to drive a car using DRL techniques.

#### Steps:
1. **Environment Setup:** Define state space, actions, and reward mechanism.
2. **Model Design:** Use a DQN or Policy Gradient method.
3. **Training:** Implement experience replay, target network.
4. **Evaluation:** Test the AI in different scenarios.
5. **Fine-Tuning:** Optimize hyperparameters for better performance.

```python
# Pseudo-code for Car Racing Game
state = env.reset()
while not done:
    action = agent.act(state)
    next_state, reward, done = env.step(action)
    agent.remember(state, action, reward, next_state, done)
    agent.replay()
    state = next_state
```
```python
# Keras DQN Agent
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras.optimizers import Adam

class DQNAgent:
    def __init__(self, state_size, action_size):
        self.model = self.build_model(state_size, action_size)
    
    def build_model(self, state_size, action_size):
        model = Sequential()
        model.add(Dense(24, input_dim=state_size, activation='relu'))
        model.add(Dense(24, activation='relu'))
        model.add(Dense(action_size, activation='linear'))
        model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.001))
        return model
```
